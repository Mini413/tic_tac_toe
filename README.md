# tic_tac_toe
This is a command line Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. It can be run in Windows command prompt as long as you have downloaded the program.py file and have a Python interpreter downloaded to your system (https://www.python.org/downloads/). This code has been written in the 3.10.4 version of Python. Alternatively, the debug feature in VS Code can be used to run the program.

It is your classic Tic-Tac-Toe, but there is room to expand it to do different/new things, such as expand to a 4x4 or 5x5 game board during a game. This was my first proper attempt at writing a program in OOP, it was difficult to not think in with a procedural mindset, so I am hoping this is a good first attempt at OOP.

Also, they may be a future opportunity of designing a GUI using tkinter but I want to get more farmiliar with OOP before attempting that.
